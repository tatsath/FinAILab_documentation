Natural Language Processing
===========================

   Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with
   the problems of making a machine understand the structure and the
   meaning of natural language as used by humans. Several techniques of
   machine learning and deep learning are used within NLP.

   NLP has many applications in the finance sectors in areas such as
   sentiment analysis, chatbots, and document processing. A lot of
   information, such as sell side reports, earnings calls, and newspaper
   headlines, is communicated via text message, making NLP quite useful
   in the financial domain.

   Given the extensive application of NLP algorithms based on machine
   learning in finance, there is a separate chapter of this book
   (`Chapter 10 <#_bookmark722>`__) dedicated to NLP and related case
   studies.
