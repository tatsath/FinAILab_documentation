Supervised
----------

   The main goal in *supervised learning* is to train a model from
   labeled data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or
   future data. Here, the term *supervised* refers to a set of samples
   where the desired output signals (labels) are already known. There
   are two types of supervised learning algorithms: classification and
   regression.

Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   *Classification* is a subcategory of supervised learning in which the
   goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances
   based on past observations.

Regression
~~~~~~~~~~

   *Regression* is another subcategory of supervised learning used in
   the prediction of continuous outcomes. In regression, we are given a
   number of predictor (explana‚Äê tory) variables and a continuous
   response variable (outcome or target), and we try to find a
   relationship between those variables that allows us to predict an
   outcome.

   An example of regression versus classification is shown in
   `Figure 1-3 <#_bookmark42>`__. The chart on the left shows an example
   of regression. The continuous response variable is return, and the
   observed values are plotted against the predicted outcomes. On the
   right, the outcome is a categorical class label, whether the market
   is bull or bear, and is an example of classification.
