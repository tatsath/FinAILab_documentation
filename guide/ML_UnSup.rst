Unsupervised
------------

   Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning used to draw
   inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled
   responses. There are two types of unsupervised learning:
   dimensionality reduction and clustering.

Dimensionality reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   *Dimensionality reduction* is the process of reducing the number of
   features, or vari‐ ables, in a dataset while preserving information
   and overall model performance. It is a common and powerful way to
   deal with datasets that have a large number of dimensions.

   Here the dimension of data is converted from two dimensions (*X\ 1*
   and *X\ 2*) to one dimension (*Z\ 1*). *Z\ 1* conveys similar
   information embedded in *X\ 1* and *X\ 2* and reduces the dimension
   of the data.

Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~

   *Clustering* is a subcategory of unsupervised learning techniques
   that allows us to dis‐ cover hidden structures in data. The goal of
   clustering is to find a natural grouping in data so that items in the
   same cluster are more similar to each other than to those from
   different clusters.

   *Figure 1-5. Clustering*

   An example of clustering is shown in `Figure
   1-5 <#_bookmark48>`__, where we can see the entire data clustered
   into two distinct groups by the clustering algorithm.
