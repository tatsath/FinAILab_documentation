**Machine Learning in Finance:**

**The Landscape**

   *Machine learning promises to shake up large swathes of finance*

   —The Economist (2017)

   There is a new wave of machine learning and data science in finance,
   and the related applications will transform the industry over the
   next few decades.

   Currently, most financial firms, including hedge funds, investment
   and retail banks, and fintech firms, are adopting and investing
   heavily in machine learning. Going for‐ ward, financial institutions
   will need a growing number of machine learning and data science
   experts.

   Machine learning in finance has become more prominent recently due to
   the availa‐ bility of vast amounts of data and more affordable
   computing power. The use of data science and machine learning is
   exploding exponentially across all areas of finance.

   The success of machine learning in finance depends upon building
   efficient infra‐ structure, using the correct toolkit, and applying
   the right algorithms. The concepts related to these building blocks
   of machine learning in finance are demonstrated and utilized
   throughout this book.

   In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the current and future
   application of machine learning in finance, including a brief
   overview of different types of machine learning. This chapter and the
   two that follow serve as the foundation for the case studies
   presented in the rest of the book.

Current and Future Machine Learning Applications in Finance
===========================================================

   Let’s take a look at some promising machine learning applications in
   finance. The case studies presented in this book cover all the
   applications mentioned here.

Algorithmic Trading
-------------------

   *Algorithmic trading* (or simply *algo trading*) is the use of
   algorithms to conduct trades autonomously. With origins going back to
   the 1970s, algorithmic trading (sometimes called Automated Trading
   Systems, which is arguably a more accurate description) involves the
   use of automated preprogrammed trading instructions to make extremely
   fast, objective trading decisions.

   Machine learning stands to push algorithmic trading to new levels.
   Not only can more advanced strategies be employed and adapted in real
   time, but machine learn‐ ing–based techniques can offer even more
   avenues for gaining special insight into market movements. Most hedge
   funds and financial institutions do not openly dis‐ close their
   machine learning–based approaches to trading (for good reason), but
   machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in
   calibrating trading decisions in real time.

Portfolio Management and Robo-Advisors
--------------------------------------

   Asset and wealth management firms are exploring potential artificial
   intelligence (AI) solutions for improving their investment decisions
   and making use of their troves of historical data.

   One example of this is the use of *robo-advisors*, algorithms built
   to calibrate a finan‐ cial portfolio to the goals and risk tolerance
   of the user. Additionally, they provide automated financial guidance
   and service to end investors and clients.

   A user enters their financial goals (e.g., to retire at age 65 with
   $250,000 in savings), age, income, and current financial assets. The
   advisor (the *allocator*) then spreads investments across asset
   classes and financial instruments in order to reach the user’s goals.

   The system then calibrates to changes in the user’s goals and
   real-time changes in the market, aiming always to find the best fit
   for the user’s original goals. Robo-advisors have gained significant
   traction among consumers who do not need a human advisor to feel
   comfortable investing.

Fraud Detection
---------------

   Fraud is a massive problem for financial institutions and one of the
   foremost reasons to leverage machine learning in finance.

   There is currently a significant data security risk due to high
   computing power, fre‐ quent internet use, and an increasing amount of
   company data being stored online. While previous financial fraud
   detection systems depended heavily on complex and robust sets of
   rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of
   risk factors—it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or
   real) security threats.

   Machine learning is ideally suited to combating fraudulent financial
   transactions. This is because machine learning systems can scan
   through vast datasets, detect unusual activities, and flag them
   instantly. Given the incalculably high number of ways that security
   can be breached, genuine machine learning systems will be an absolute
   necessity in the days to come.

Loans/Credit Card/Insurance Underwriting
----------------------------------------

   Underwriting could be described as a perfect job for machine learning
   in finance, and indeed there is a great deal of worry in the industry
   that machines will replace a large swath of underwriting positions
   that exist today.

   Especially at large companies (big banks and publicly traded
   insurance firms), machine learning algorithms can be trained on
   millions of examples of consumer data and financial lending or
   insurance outcomes, such as whether a person defaulted on their loan
   or mortgage.

   Underlying financial trends can be assessed with algorithms and
   continuously ana‐ lyzed to detect trends that might influence lending
   and underwriting risk in the future. Algorithms can perform automated
   tasks such as matching data records, identifying exceptions, and
   calculating whether an applicant qualifies for a credit or insurance
   product.

Automation and Chatbots
-----------------------

   Automation is patently well suited to finance. It reduces the strain
   that repetitive, low-value tasks put on human employees. It tackles
   the routine, everyday processes, freeing up teams to finish their
   high-value work. In doing so, it drives enormous time and cost
   savings.

   Adding machine learning and AI into the automation mix adds another
   level of sup‐ port for employees. With access to relevant data,
   machine learning and AI can pro‐ vide an in-depth data analysis to
   support finance teams with difficult decisions. In some cases, it may
   even be able to recommend the best course of action for employ‐ ees
   to approve and enact.

   AI and automation in the financial sector can also learn to recognize
   errors, reducing the time wasted between discovery and resolution.
   This means that human team members are less likely to be delayed in
   providing their reports and are able to com‐ plete their work with
   fewer errors.

   AI chatbots can be implemented to support finance and banking
   customers. With the rise in popularity of live chat software in
   banking and finance businesses, chatbots are the natural evolution.

Risk Management
---------------

   Machine learning techniques are transforming how we approach risk
   management. All aspects of understanding and controlling risk are
   being revolutionized through the growth of solutions driven by
   machine learning. Examples range from deciding how much a bank should
   lend a customer to improving compliance and reducing model risk.

Asset Price Prediction
----------------------

   Asset price prediction is considered the most frequently discussed
   and most sophisti‐ cated area in finance. Predicting asset prices
   allows one to understand the factors that drive the market and
   speculate asset performance. Traditionally, asset price predic‐ tion
   was performed by analyzing past financial reports and market
   performance to determine what position to take for a specific
   security or asset class. However, with a tremendous increase in the
   amount of financial data, the traditional approaches for analysis and
   stock-selection strategies are being supplemented with ML-based
   techniques.

Derivative Pricing
------------------

   Recent machine learning successes, as well as the fast pace of
   innovation, indicate that ML applications for derivatives pricing
   should become widely used in the com‐ ing years. The world of
   Black-Scholes models, volatility smiles, and Excel spreadsheet models
   should wane as more advanced methods become readily available.

   The classic derivative pricing models are built on several
   impractical assumptions to reproduce the empirical relationship
   between the underlying input data (strike price, time to maturity,
   option type) and the price of the derivatives observed in the market.
   Machine learning methods do not rely on several assumptions; they
   just try to esti‐ mate a function between the input data and price,
   minimizing the difference between the results of the model and the
   target.

   The faster deployment times achieved with state-of-the-art ML tools
   are just one of the advantages that will accelerate the use of
   machine learning in derivatives pricing.

Sentiment Analysis
------------------

   Sentiment analysis involves the perusal of enormous volumes of
   unstructured data, such as videos, transcriptions, photos, audio
   files, social media posts, articles, and business documents, to
   determine market sentiment. Sentiment analysis is crucial for all
   businesses in today’s workplace and is an excellent example of
   machine learning in finance.

   The most common use of sentiment analysis in the financial sector is
   the analysis of financial news—in particular, predicting the
   behaviors and possible trends of mar‐ kets. The stock market moves in
   response to myriad human-related factors, and the hope is that
   machine learning will be able to replicate and enhance human
   intuition about financial activity by discovering new trends and
   telling signals.

   However, much of the future applications of machine learning will be
   in understand‐ ing social media, news trends, and other data sources
   related to predicting the senti‐ ments of customers toward market
   developments. It will not be limited to predicting stock prices and
   trades.

Trade Settlement
----------------

   Trade settlement is the process of transferring securities into the
   account of a buyer and cash into the seller’s account following a
   transaction of a financial asset.

   Despite the majority of trades being settled automatically, and with
   little or no inter‐ action by human beings, about 30% of trades need
   to be settled manually.

   The use of machine learning not only can identify the reason for
   failed trades, but it also can analyze why the trades were rejected,
   provide a solution, and predict which trades may fail in the future.
   What usually would take a human being five to ten minutes to fix,
   machine learning can do in a fraction of a second.

Money Laundering
----------------

   A United Nations report estimates that the amount of money laundered
   worldwide per year is 2%–5% of global GDP. Machine learning
   techniques can analyze internal, publicly existing, and transactional
   data from a client’s broader network in an attempt to spot money
   laundering signs.
